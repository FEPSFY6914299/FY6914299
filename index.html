<h3 id="Abstract">Abstract</h3>
<div class="ex1">
<pre>
This paper will address some of the regulation changes that most directly affect aerodynamics brought in by the FIA in the last 20 years. It will delve into how teams have adapted in response to these changes and discuss implications of these new designs. It will also consider a future rule change that will come into effect in the 2026 season.

<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
<div class="ex1">
<p>
Formula 1 is the pinnacle of motorsports with roughly 800 million fans worldwide (Brittle, 2025). In this sport, the slightest changes to the vehicle can drastically change the outcome of a race. The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) enforces a rulebook ensuring safe and fair competition. Over the past two decades the FIA regulations have directly affected the aerodynamic design of the cars.

<h3 id="Regulations">2.1 – 2009 Regulations</h3>
<div class="ex1">
<p>
The 2009 regulations were introduced (Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile, 2009) primarily to reduce the wake from a leading car to improve overtaking. The biggest changes include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Front wing – became wider and moved lower</li>
<li>Rear wing – became thinner and taller</li>
<li>Surface appendages – restricted, forcing simpler bodywork</li>
</ul>
<p>
These changes led to whole car redesigns to balance the front and rear downforce. Teams focused innovation on diffuser interactions.
